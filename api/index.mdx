Introduction
This reference contains the information needed to integrate BaseOne APIs into your application.

BaseOne is your one-stop shop for Fintech services and functionalities. You can select the features or services you want to use to build your application and integrate the respective APIs. You also get to select countries where you intend to deploy your application.

The BaseOne APIs are REST-based. They have resource-oriented URLs that accept request bodies and return appropriate JSON-encoded responses with conventional HTTP status codes, verbs, and authentication.

You can use the API test keys in test mode without affecting your real instances and integrations to external services.
