# üí∏ Payouts

**Learn how to make payments with BaseOne**

BaseOne Payouts allows you to send out funds instantly to one or multiple recipients. Payouts can be used for e-commerce refunds, salary payments, and loan disbursements. You can pay out funds to one or multiple accounts in Ghana, Kenya, or Nigeria, and the funds get settled almost instantly.

To get started, [sign up](https://app.baseone.co/) for a new account if you don't have one yet. Then, onboard Payouts to your merchant dashboard. We will send your onboarding confirmation via email. You can then initiate payouts directly from your dashboard or with the API.

3. Click **Payments** to open the Payments services page.
4. Hover over **Payouts** and click the **Open** button to go to the Payouts overview page.
5. On the **Payouts** overview page, click **Onboard** and follow the prompts to initiate the onboarding request. We will notify you via email within two business days regarding the approval status.
