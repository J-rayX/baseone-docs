Learn how to receive payments from multiple channels and countries

Collect helps your business get paid with speed. It is the cheapest way to receive funds from different countries across multiple channels, including bank transfers and cards. You can use the [Collect API](https://developer.baseone.co/reference/payment-charge) or the Collect widget for your collection.

## Collect benefits

Some of the benefits BaseOne avails you with Collect are:

1. **Multi-channel Collection:** You can accept payment for goods and services rendered via various channels from different countries. Collect also offers full white labeling for interested businesses.
2. **Fast Settlement:** Collect offers a settlement period ranging from 4-12 hours after payment, depending on the payment channel used.

## Collection Channels

**Bank Transfer**  
 You can collect funds by bank transfer.

**Card Payment**  
You can accept funds from debit and credit cards in your integration.

**Mobile Money**  
You can accept funds through the mobile money channel.

## Collect Methods

**Collect API**  
The API provides endpoints for processing collections. You can use different channels such as bank transfer, card payment, and mobile money.

**Collect Widget**  
We built an interactive JavaScript widget so you can embed it in your application to easily handle the entire collection process for you end-to-end.

## Things to note:

### **PCI-DSS License:**

You need the PCID license to collect funds if you operate from Nigeria. You must have confirmed your license in the **Compliance** section of your BaseOne dashboard. If you don't have the PCI-DSS license, you can only use the Collect widget. However, license holders can use both the API and the widget.
