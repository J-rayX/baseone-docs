Transfer endpoints
Make inter-bank transfers with virtual accounts with the Virtual Accounts API



This API helps you transfer between multiple virtual accounts and bank accounts outside the BaseOne ecosystem.

- Only static accounts can directly transfer funds. Dynamic accounts are temporary and, therefore, can't be used to make fund transfers. 

- All the funds received in the static-collection accounts in your merchant integration are held in a single merchant holding account. You can therefore make fund transfers from the holding account.
