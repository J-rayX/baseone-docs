# Modes of Transaction

## Virtual Account Transfers

This section explains the type of fund transfers possible with [Virtual Accounts](https://developer.baseone.co/docs/virtualaccounts).  
**Intra-wallet account transfer:** funds transfer from a static account to another static account. Only static accounts can make transfers in the Virtual Accounts service because they have an accounting ledger.

**Inter-wallet account transfer:** transfer funds from a static account in BaseOne to an account outside BaseOne. In your merchant integration, you can move money to a commercial bank account from a BaseOne static account, static-collection holding account, or corporate wallet.

## Kind of Transactions

This section explains the difference between credit and debit transactions in Virtual Accounts.  
**Credit transaction:** moves funds from the corporate wallet into a static account in BaseOne.

**Debit transaction:** moves money from a static account to a Virtual Accounts collection account or corporate wallet.
