Collect Notification Payload

## Background Info on Webhook Events

When transactions happen, you receive notifications from BaseOne in the form of events. An event is delivered to you through your pre-configured webhook URL.

See the steps to [configure the webhook URL](https://developer.baseone.co/docs/webhooks#how-to-register-your-webhook-url-on-the-baseone-dashboard) in your BaseOne dashboard **Developer** settings. 

The payload body of an event received through a webhook URL looks like the following:

```text Sample event payload
"payload": {
	"EventName": "CollectNotification"
	"EventTime": "2022-080-15 01:15:30"
	"EventService": "Notification"
	"NotificationData": "{JSON Object in String}"
	"EventId": "2fc5bc14-2e0d-4541-bca7-9082b682243a"
}
```

- Each event carries a similar payload structure, as shown above. 
- The `NotificationData` field in the above code snippet is an object that carries full details about the event. 
- The `NotificationData` field follows the JSON format to capture several data points about the event service.
