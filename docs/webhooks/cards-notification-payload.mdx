# ðŸ’³ Cards Notification Payload

## ðŸ”” Background Info on Webhook Events

When transactions occur, event notifications are delivered to your pre-configured webhook URL.

ðŸ”§ To set up your webhook URL:

2. Navigate to **Developer** settings
3. Follow the steps to [configure the webhook URL ðŸ”—](https://developer.baseone.co/docs/webhooks#how-to-register-your-webhook-url-on-the-baseone-dashboard)

## ðŸ“¦ Sample Event Payload

The payload body of an event received through a webhook URL looks like this:

```text Sample event payload
"payload": {
  "EventName": "CardNotification"
  "EventTime": "2022-080-15 01:15:30"
  "EventService": "CardTransactionNotification"
  "NotificationData": "{JSON Object in String}"
  "EventId": "2fc5bc14-2e0d-4541-bca7-9082b682243a"
}
```

- Each event carries a similar payload structure, as shown above.
- The `NotificationData` field in the above code snippet is an object that carries full details about the event.
