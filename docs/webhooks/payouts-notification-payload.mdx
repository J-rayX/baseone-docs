# 💸 Payouts Notification Payload

## 🔔 Background Info on Webhook Events

When transactions occur, BaseOne sends notifications to your pre-configured webhook URL in the form of events.

🔧 To set up your webhook URL:

1. Log into your BaseOne dashboard
2. Navigate to **Developer** settings
3. Follow the steps to [configure your Webhook URL 🔗](/docs/webhooks/#how-to-register-your-webhook-url-on-the-baseone-dashboard)

## 📦 Notification Payload

The payload body of a Payouts transaction event received through a webhook URL looks like this:

```text Sample event payload
"payload": {
	"EventName": "PayoutNotification"
	"EventTime": "2022-080-15 01:15:30"
	"EventService": "Notification"
	"NotificationData": "{JSON Object in String}"
	"EventId": "2fc5bc14-2e0d-4541-bca7-9082b682243a"
}
```

> 📝 Note:
>
> - Each event carries a similar payload structure.
> - The `NotificationData` field is a JSON object (as a string) with full event details.
> - The `NotificationData` field uses JSON format to capture various data points about the event service.
