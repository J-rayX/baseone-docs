Payouts Notification Payload

## Background Info on Webhook Events

When transactions happen, you receive notifications from BaseOne in the form of events. An event is delivered to you through the pre-configured webhook URL you set in your BaseOne dashboard's **Developer** settings. 

Follow the [steps to configure your Webhook URL](https://developer.baseone.co/docs/webhooks#how-to-register-your-webhook-url-on-the-baseone-dashboard) in your developer dashboard.

## Notification Payload

The payload body of a Payouts transaction event that you will receive through a webhook URL looks like the following:

```text Sample event payload
"payload": {
	"EventName": "PayoutNotification"
	"EventTime": "2022-080-15 01:15:30"
	"EventService": "Notification"
	"NotificationData": "{JSON Object in String}"
	"EventId": "2fc5bc14-2e0d-4541-bca7-9082b682243a"
}
```

- Each event carries a similar payload structure, as shown above. 
- The `NotificationData` field in the above code snippet is an object that carries full details about the event. 
- The `NotificationData` field follows the JSON format to capture several data points about the event service.
