## 🌐 Sandbox vs. Live Production Mode

Access the service on the dashboard using the URLs below, depending on whether you are testing in the sandbox or working in production mode.

**For the UI:**

```bash
# Sandbox UI
https://sandbox-app.baseone.co/{service_name}

# Live UI
https://baseone.co/{service_name}

```

**For the API gateway:**

```curl API Sandbox
# API Sandbox
https://sandbox.baseone.co/{service_name}

# API Live
https://gateway.baseone.co/{service_name}

```

`{service_name}` is the name of the service you are integrating. See the following table:

| Name of service  | `{service_name}`   |     |
| :--------------- | :----------------- | :-- |
| Virtual Accounts | `virtual_accounts` |     |
| Payouts          | `payouts`          |     |
