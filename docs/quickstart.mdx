# Quickstart

Get up and running with your BaseOne integration in the following steps:

1. [Sign up](https://app.baseone.co/signin) for an account if you don't have one yet.
2. Log in to your dashboard and go to the **Developers** section.
3. Create new keys and note your [API keys](https://developer.baseone.co/docs/authentication#create-api-keys).
4. To create digital wallets for your customers, see our [Wallets-as-a-service](https://developer.baseone.co/docs/wallets) offering.
5. If you need temporary or permanent accounts to collect funds, see our [Virtual Accounts](https://developer.baseone.co/docs/virtualaccounts) offering.
6. To make fund payouts and disbursements, see our [Payouts API](https://developer.baseone.co/docs/payouts).
7. You can always use the API sandbox to test your integration before going live.
8. Launch your integration when you're ready to go live!

## On sandbox and live production mode

Go to the service on the dashboard with the following URL, depending on whether you are testing in the sandbox or want to work in production mode. 

```curl Sandbox UI
https://sandbox-app.baseone.co/{service_name}
```
```curl Live UI
https://baseone.co/{service_name}
```

For the API gateway:

```curl API Sandbox
https://sandbox.baseone.co/{service_name}
```
```curl API Live
https://gateway.baseone.co/{service_name}
```

`{service_name}` is the name of the service you are integrating. See the following table:

| Name of service  | `{service_name}`   |    |
| :--------------- | :----------------- | :- |
| Virtual Accounts | `virtual_accounts` |    |
| Payouts          | `payouts`          |    |
